# mobile-asn
An open source and crowd sourced list of mobile carrier ASNs. The list is available in tsv format only at the moment. 

## How to contribute?
The list is sourced using Pull Requests on GitHub. There is also a way by adding them via [iammobile](https://github.com/innovate-technologies/iammobile), this is a website to automaticly submit entries. We host ours at https://iammobile.shoutca.st

## How complete is it?
Far from, we just started doing this. All help is welcome!

## Why do you do this?
We offer internet radio streaming and would like to be able to offer a redirect to a lower bitrate on mobile networks without compromising for smartphones that are being used on WiFi. We think that using the IP's ASN might be the best option for this. Currently we havn't found any open databases of ASNs of wireless networks, onky commercial ones like Maxmind.  
At Innovate we beleive in openness therefor started this project.
